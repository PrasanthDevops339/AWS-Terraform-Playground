# Data Perimeter (Production)
#
# This is a placeholder for any data-perimeter-related policy targeting (e.g., restricting cross-account
# data access patterns). Keep environment-specific targeting here if you choose to manage those policies
# in this repo.
#
# Example structure (intentionally commented):
# locals {
#   data_perimeter_targets = [
#     var.workloads,
#     var.workloadsLEGACY,
#   ]
# }
